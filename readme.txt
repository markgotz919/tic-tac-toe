4) It was hard to figure out the best way to set up the board, and figure out how the program would be able to register which box was clicked.  It was also hard to figure out if there was a winner because if the program saw matching empty squares it would also register a win, so I had to make sure there was something in the box.  It took a lot of time to make the sign up, sign in, and sign out work.


5) Unsolved Problems and Future Improvements:
        a) I wasn't able to implement the theme for the game that I was planning.  
                *This tic-tac-toe game was planned to have a state capital theme.  Future versions of the game with have.
                        <> USA state theme.
                        <> Include State Capital questions before players can make a move on board.
                        <> Allow players to pick a state flag instead of X or O, and have the flags appear on the grid.
                        <>When a player wins include fireworks celebration display.
                        <> Highlight the 3 in the row that create win.
                        <> Inclue game over message.
                        <> Have to set up way for the game to be able to track moves and savethem to database.
